Module Name:

    redblack.fnc

Abstract:
    
    This module implements the red/black trees via macros for structure
    field independence (so that we can use the same code with different 
    fields by just redefining the macros).  This file is included by 
    redblack.c, which also defines the function names.
    
Credits:
    This code is largly based on pseud-code by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest
    in "Introduction to Algorithms", MIT press, 1989:  QA76.6.C662

INTRODUCTION:

A red/black tree is a binary tree with the following properties:
1) Every node is either red or black
2) Every leaf (NIL, **NOT** NULL) is black.  Note that in our implementation
    this is accomplished by having all leaves be NIL which is black by
    definition.
3) If a node is red, then both its children are black
4) Every simple path from a node to a descendent leaf contains the same
   number of black nodes

These properties imply that every red/black tree is "approximately balanced",
thus red/black trees have logarithmic time operations.  The find operation
is identical to that of a regular binary tree, and is thus especially fast.
Insert and delete operations are complicated by the fact that after the
regular binary tree operation, one must take special care to ensure that the
red/black properties hold for the new tree.  This is accomplished via right
and left rotations.

Note that the empty tree is denoted by NIL, not NULL.  NIL is an actual
node passed to all the red/black tree functions, and greatly simplifies
coding by eliminating special cases (this also yields faster running time).
